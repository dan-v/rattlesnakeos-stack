### Full Config Used for Setup
You can mask stack name and email from here.
```
chromium-version = ""
device = "crosshatch"
instance-regions = "us-west-2,us-west-1,us-east-1,us-east-2"
instance-type = "c5.4xlarge"
max-price = "1.00"
name = "<not important>"
region = "us-west-2"
schedule = "cron(0 0 10 * ? *)"
skip-price = "1.00"
ssh-key = "rattlesnakeos"

### Full log
Sometimes the output from the email notification will not be enough to diagnose the issue. Including the full log file can help. You can find log files in your S3 bucket `<stackname>-logs/<device>/<timestamp>`. If you don't want to share it publicly we can find a way to share and debug it offline.
